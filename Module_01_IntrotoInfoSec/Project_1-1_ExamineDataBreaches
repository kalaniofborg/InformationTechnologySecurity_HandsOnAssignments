Project 1-1: Examine Data Breaches – Visual  
Estimated Time: 20 minutes 
Objective: Research the biggest data breaches. 
Description: In this project, you use a visual format to view the biggest data breaches resulting in stolen information. 
1.	Open your web browser and enter the URL http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks. (If you are no longer able to access the site through this web address, use a search engine to search for “Information Is Beautiful World’s Biggest Data Breaches.”) 
2.	This site will display a visual graphic of the data breaches, similar to Figure 1-6. 
3.	Scroll down the page to view the data breaches by year. Note that the size of the breach is indicated by the size of the bubble. 
4.	Scroll back up to the top. 
5.	Hover over several bubbles to read a quick story of the breach. 
6.	Note the color of the bubbles that have an “Interesting Story.” Click one of the bubbles and read the story. When finished, close only this tab in your browser. 
7.	Click filter to display the filter menu. 
8.	Under sector, click retail to view those breaches related to the retail industry. 
9.	Click one of the bubbles and read the story. 
10.	Click RESET in the filter menu. 
11.	Select the sector finance. 
12.	Select the method poor security. 
13.	Click one of the bubbles and read the story. 
14.	Create your own filters to view different types of breaches. Does this graphic convey a compelling story of data breaches? 
15.	How does this visualization help you with the understanding of threats? 
16.	Close all windows. 


# Question #1: Does this graphic convey a compelling story of data breaches? 
Yes, this interactive graphic displaying the numerous amounts of information regarding various types of data breaches and hacks from various sectors. 
The ability to filter through the data to view how large breaches and hacks shows a frightening visual display of data breaches. Immediently, I recognized one of the companies that I regularly use. 
It paints a stark image how so many people- including myself- can be affected by data breaches and hacks that occur everyday throughout the whole world. 


# Question #2: How does this visualization help you with the understanding of threats?
Being able to visualize large scale data into bubbles with information allows me to better see the scale of massive amounts of people that are affected by these data breaches and hacks.
Visualizing data in an informative and interactive way puts it into perspective the scope of the threat vector- which can feel massive, with some breaches affecting an upwards of 300+ million users. 
As I scroll through the lists, it seems like there have been improvements in the past few years regarding security. But as technology advances, so does the skills of hackers and threat vectors.
